This repository includes simple implementations for certain non-smooth, non-convex optimisation problems arising in data processing. Exemplar applications include:
- compressed sensing
- matrix completion/sensing
- robust low-rank estimation (Robust PCA)
- sparse prinicipal subspace estimation (Sparse PCA)

The main goal is to **stop rewritting the same projected gradient method** all over again and to have a **unified** treatment of linear operators, e.g. curvelets, and a set of quick tests to quickly assess efficiancy of the algorithms.
