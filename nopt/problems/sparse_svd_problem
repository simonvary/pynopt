    Problem class for setting up a problem to feed to one of the solvers.
    Attributes:
        - A
            A linear operator going from R^n to R^m
        - verbosity (2)
            Level of information printed by the solver while it operates, 0
            is silent, 2 is most information.
    Methods:
        - cost
            Least squares cost
        - gradient
            Gradient of the cost in x
